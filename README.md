# Maria Waslick's Responsive Portfolio

> In our current age of mobile internet usage, it is important for every website to be accessible via small screens as well as big ones. My name is Maria Waslick, and I have created this portfolio to practice utilizing mobile responsive layouts, Bootstrap 4 and its premade components, and creating web layouts with CSS design. In viewing this portfolio, you will learn a little more about me, view photos I have taken, and can even send me a message!

## General Info 
My portfolio is divided into three sections: <b>About</b>, <b>Portfolio</b>, and <b>Contact</b>. The <b>About</b> section contains a paragraph about me, as well as a photo of me and a link to my GitHub so visitors can view my other coding projects. In the <b>Portfolio</b> section, you can view six photos I have taken in my spare time. And the <b>Contact</b> section contains a form where visitors can input their name, e-mail address, and a message for me.

All elements of the layout are responsive whether you are on a desktop or mobile screen: the navigation bar collapses in smaller screens, and the information card and images rearrange to fit the screen size as it shrinks. My portfolio also contains many of Bootstrap's components (such as the navbar, the card, the form, and the img-fluid property) and utilizes Bootstrap's grid system. I have also put my own personal twist on the layout by adding fonts from Google Fonts and changing some of the CSS elements.
